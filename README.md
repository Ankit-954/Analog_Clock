# Analog_Clock
An analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a simple but effective way to display the time on a web page. It can be customized to match any design, and it can be made to be responsive to different screen sizes.

To create an analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

 1) HTML file that contains the basic structure of the clock, including the clock face, the hour, minute, and second hands, and the twelve hour markers.
 2) CSS file that styles the clock, including the colors, sizes, and shapes of the different elements.
 3) JavaScript file that updates the position of the hour, minute, and second hands based on the current time.
